# bnn_tensorflow

Included is the tensorflow translation of the original Theano/lasagne BNN inference code, based on the BNN paper by Courbariaux et al.  
In my test runs, it produces an error of 12.08%.  
Versions for both the older 0.10 and current 1.1 CPU-only versions of tensorflow are included. 
Both versions are run as scripts, i.e. by calling "python cifar10_inference.py".
